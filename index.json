Several recent works have studied the stability of such waves to so-called 'subharmonic' perturbations, i.e. $NT$-periodic perturbations for some natural number $N$. However, these results are degenerate for large $N$ since both the rate of decay of perturbations, along with the domain of attraction, both tend to zero as N tends to infinity. In this talk, I will discuss a new methodology for obtaining subharmonic stability results for the LLE which are uniform in $N$. This approach is quite general, and applies to a wide class of dissipative models.","tags":["stability","dissipative models"],"title":"Stability of periodic Lugiato-Lefever Waves","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Gong Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1634659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634659200,"objectID":"dfe23a49b5600b42f5ca2909763b29ad","permalink":"//ucmath.github.io/talk/gong-chen-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-29T10:18:12Z","relpermalink":"/talk/gong-chen-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"We will consider the long-time dynamics of small solutions to the 1d cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) with a trapping potential. I will illustrate that  that every small solution will decompose into a small solitary wave and a radiation term which exhibits the modified scattering. In particular, this result implies the asymptotic stability of small solitary waves. The analysis also establishes the long-time behavior of solutions to a perturbation of the integrable cubic NLS with the appearance of solitons.","tags":["long-time asymptotics","nonlinear Schrödinger equation"],"title":"Long-time dynamics of small solutions to 1d cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equations with a trapping potential","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Benjamin Akers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1633449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633449600,"objectID":"8d2c98484a947c48b1bf88bf2b8169cf","permalink":"//ucmath.github.io/talk/akers-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-29T10:18:12Z","relpermalink":"/talk/akers-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Nonlinear waves occur in a wide variety of applications, including laser propagation, oceanography, combustion, and more. In special circumstances these waves resonate, resulting in bifurcating solution branches in the nonlinear problem. In this talk we consider the asymptotics, existence, and analyticity of these solution branches. Two distinct proofs of existence are discussed: the first is based on a perturbation series, the second is a contraction mapping argument. Both proofs spawn numerical methods. The numerical methods are compared, and results from each are presented. The application of these methods to the spectral stability problem, where resonances occur at eigenvalue collisions, is discussed.","tags":["wave resonances","Wilton ripples"],"title":"Wave resonances: existence and computation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Thomas Trogdon"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631384077,"objectID":"8d965bc2ca2b2223672455aaca4ed321","permalink":"//ucmath.github.io/talk/trogdon-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-29T10:18:12Z","relpermalink":"/talk/trogdon-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"We consider the numerical evaluation of the forward and inverse scattering transforms for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. For the initial-value problem (IVP) for decaying data on the line, we review existing numerical techniques and discuss successes using new basis functions. Extensions of these ideas to step-like data and to the IVP with periodic initial data will also be discussed. The latter requires a recent approach to the numerical computation of the so-called Baker-Akhiezer function of a large-genus hyperelliptic Riemann surface. All approaches produce accurate numerical solutions in the long-time regime.","tags":["Riemann-Hilbert problems","Korteweg-de Vries equaiton","numerical inverse-scattering transform"],"title":"Numerical inverse scattering for the KdV equation revisited","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Deniz Bilman"],"categories":["@UC"],"content":"Percy Deift, Silver Professor of Mathematics from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, will be giving the Taft Lecture in Spring 2020 at the University of Cincinnati.

It turns out that the fluctuations in the time to compute the solution of the problem at hand to a desired accuracy, turn out to be universal, independent of the statistical assumptions on the data. Some of the results discussed are numerical and experimental, and some are proved rigorously. This is joint work with various authors, C. Pfrang, G. Menon, S. Olver, S.
